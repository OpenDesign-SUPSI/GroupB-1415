**Our ideas for the project:**

a. steam drawer <br>
<img src = "http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJSYmkWndbpdP4MrwM1LA4DAtU3rZMcEE1ybLkkV78CkFEfnf7MQ"> <br>
I was thinking about a device that draws image or message on the mirror. It starts working like 10 minute after a person takes a shower and then when the person comes out, s/he can checks the drawing on the mirror.
